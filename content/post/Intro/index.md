# 👋 Welcome!

Hi there — I’m thrilled to launch my personal website! After years of building machine learning models, digging through terabytes of data, and collaborating across domains, I’ve finally created a space to share my journey, ideas, and tools with the world.

I’m a **results-driven data scientist** with 7+ years of experience applying machine learning to real-world problems. My work spans:

- 🧠 **NLP** – From BERT-based classifiers to multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbots  
- 📊 **Tabular ML** – Feature engineering, tree ensembles, interpretable models  
- ⏱ **Time-series forecasting** – For financial, operational, and behavioral data  
- 🌐 **Graph analytics** – Embeddings, link prediction, and network analysis  
- ⚙️ **MLOps** – Deploying with Docker, orchestrating with Airflow, scaling on the cloud  

I hold a **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, where I focused on statistical learning, causal inference, and model interpretability. I’m deeply passionate about **ethical AI**, **cross-functional collaboration**, and **turning research into impact**.

## ✨ What to Expect from This Blog

In this blog, I’ll be sharing posts on:

- Tutorials and walkthroughs from real projects  
- Thoughts on model development, evaluation, and responsible deployment  
- Research notes on topics like causal ML, interpretable models, and generative AI  
- Reflections on industry trends and academic insights  
- Occasionally, career advice and lessons learned as a data scientist and researcher  

Whether you're a fellow practitioner, a researcher, or just AI-curious, I hope you’ll find value here.

## 🚀 Let’s Connect

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to check out my [Publications](/publications), or reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinlin-wang-ph-d-2745981aa/). I’m always open to collaborations, feedback, and good conversations.

See you around,  
**X. Wang**

## Callouts

Use [callouts](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/#callouts) (aka _asides_, _hints_, or _alerts_) to draw attention to notes, tips, and warnings.

By wrapping a paragraph in `{{%/* callout note */%}} ... {{%/* /callout */%}}`, it will render as an aside.

```markdown
{{%/* callout note */%}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{%/* /callout */%}}
```

renders as

{{% callout note %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}

Or use the `warning` callout type so your readers don't miss critical details:

{{% callout warning %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}} -->
