      * LLM-Powered Chatbot Development: Built an interactive chatbot interface using Streamlit, supporting multiple LLM backends (e.g., GPT, Mistral, LLaMA, Qwen, Deepseek) with a custom RAG pipeline for querying and summarizing financial documents uploaded by users.
      * Multi-Agent & Tool-Use: Developed modular, agent-based workflows incorporating on-demand tool-calling for document parsing, query decomposition, retrieval planning, and answer synthesis. Used techniques such as function calling, react-style agents, and tool embedding to enhance interpretability and task accuracy.
      * Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuned small and open-weight language models on proprietary financial datasets to improve document understanding, numerical reasoning, and task alignment in credit risk and financial health applications.

      * Multimodal Feature Engineering: Cleaned and enriched data from structured data and unstructured text including property listings, user clickstreams, and customer reviews. Extracted semantic features from loan applications and collateral descriptions using pre-trained BERT, significantly boosting model signal quality for credit risk assessment.
      * Scalable ML Pipeline Development: Deployed models via Alibaba Cloud, designing and maintaining Airflow DAGs to automate end-to-end workflows — from data extraction and feature generation to model inference and monitoring. Iterated to achieve 0.87 AUC in production and implemented automated retraining triggers based on PSI and AUC thresholds.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
